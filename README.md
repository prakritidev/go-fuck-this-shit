## Learning Go in 3 hours.

I've taken a task to learn Go in 3 hours, will share my notes and resource where I got the information from. 


## Project Idea.

```
As I am curretly working with elasticsearch and java, I'll create a CRUD operation REST APIs with go and elasticsearch. 
We'll Also try to compare development of go features with jdk 22 featues (preview as well). At time time of writing jdk spring boot 3.x has support for java vitiual threads I think.
maybe we'll create server usinng java classes rather than using spring or some other shit.

Let's do this.
```
